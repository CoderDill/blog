I've been building my personal website/portfolio using three different methods. First I started using Wix. My first impressions are I thought this was supposed to make building my website easier?? Second, I'm using Wordpress with similar feelings. And lastly I'm using html, bootstrap and Jquery and I'm finding this to be easier then the template sites. Still working through, I will update post once site is live and which method came out on top. Stay tuned!
